I wanted to learn C and the idea of creating an LRU Cache seemed like a reasonable project to learn the basics.  
As it turned out, I also needed to implement a Hash Map for the Cache; I decided to create it in a separate repo and include it statically [hashmap](https://github.com/StuartsHome/hashmap)
